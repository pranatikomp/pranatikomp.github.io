  Space, identity, and negotiations.
<div>
This work is a deep dive into the space of adolescents' bedrooms. It identifies distinct forms of expression and negotiation that occur in the bedroom space. The notion of a "bedroom" is expanded beyond a physical space - any social, personal, or virtual space that a teen might appropriate to make their own is a "bedroom". <br><br>

Completed as part of the Space Design course in IIT Hyderabad. <br><br>
