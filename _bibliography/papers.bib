  title={Possession and Dispossession: A Dual Phenomenon in Digital Artefacts},
  author={Kompella, Pranati and Keshavan, Neelakantan},
  abstract={A modern user's interactions with digital artefacts are a subject of interest to numerous fields of study, including human-computer interaction (HCI). Innovations in HCI necessitate an understanding of usersâ€™ attachment to these artefacts. This paper characterises user attachment as a dual phenomenon of possession and dispossession. The findings give deeper insight into the influences of this phenomenon and how they might distinguish its manifestation in physical and virtual environments. Avenues for design interventions were then interpreted from these findings.},

  title={Leveraging LLMs for Design Ideation: An AI Tool to Assist Creativity},
  author={Kokate, Rutvik and Kompella, Pranati and Onkar, Prasad},
  abstract={The creative potential of computers has intrigued researchers for decades. Since the emergence of generative AI, computer creativity has found many new dimensions and applications. As gen AI permeates mainstream discourse and usage, researchers are delving into how it can improve and complement what humans do. Creative potential is a highly relevant notion to design practice and research, especially in the initial stages of ideation and conceptualization. There is scope to improve creative potential in these stages, especially using machine intelligence. We propose a structured ideation session involving inspirational stimuli and utilize generative AI in delivering this structure to designers through ALIA: Assistive LLM-based Ideation Agent, a tool for small-group ideation scenarios. The tool is developed by enabling speech- based interactions with a Large Language Model (LLM) for inference generation. Inspiration is drawn from the synectic ideation method and the dialectics philosophy to design the optimal stimuli in group ideation. The tool is tested in design ideation sessions to compare the output of the AI-assisted ideation sessions to that of traditional ideation sessions. Preliminary findings showcase that participants have rated their ideas better when assisted by ALIA and respond favourably to speech-based interactions.},
