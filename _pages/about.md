Hi! I'm Pranati. I'm a master's student in human-computer interaction at [UT Austin](https://ischool.utexas.edu/). I have a bachelor's degree in design from [IIT Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/), and previously worked as a researcher at the [IDeaS Lab](https://cpdm.iisc.ac.in/cpdm/ideaslab/) in [IISc](https://iisc.ac.in/). 

In my [recent work](https://pranatikomp.github.io/publications/), I have been broadly studying the cognitive and affective experiences of people interacting with digital information. I am particularly interested in human perception, decision-making, learning, and creativity. Some of the big questions I think about: <i>How do humans fundamentally <b>perceive</b> their surroundings? How do they form a <b>unified experience</b> of the world? How does this experience differ for different people?</i> 

My [projects](https://pranatikomp.github.io/projects/) page explains my work in more detail. My [reading list](https://pranatikomp.github.io/reading/) sheds more light on all of my interests, research or otherwise.
