Hi! I'm Pranati. I'm a design student and researcher studying design creativity, HCI, and design aides. I have a bachelor's degree in design from [IIT Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/), and am presently working at the [IDeaS Lab](https://cpdm.iisc.ac.in/cpdm/ideaslab/) in [IISc](https://iisc.ac.in/). 

In my [recent work](https://pranatikomp.github.io/publications/), I have been studying the cognitive and affective experiences of people interacting in digital spaces. I am particularly interested in learning and creativity during information interaction. Enhancing these functions for individuals of varied cognitive capacity is a direction I wish to pursue in my future research. Some of the big questions I think about: <i>How do humans fundamentally <b>perceive</b> their surroundings? How do they form a <b>unified experience</b> of the world? How does this experience differ for different people?</i>  My [reading list](https://pranatikomp.github.io/reading/) sheds more light on all of my interests, research or otherwise.
