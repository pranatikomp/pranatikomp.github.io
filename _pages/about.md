Hi! I'm Pranati. I'm a design student and researcher studying design creativity, HCI, and design aides. I'm presently working at the [IDeaS Lab](https://cpdm.iisc.ac.in/cpdm/ideaslab/) in [IISc](https://iisc.ac.in/). I have a bachelor's degree in design from [IIT Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/). 

In my [recent work](https://pranatikomp.github.io/publications/), I examine the tools, methods, and systems that can augment human capability during the design process and conceptualise novel ones. I also study attachments and interactions in digital spaces, and am particularly interested in the cognitive phenomena that make up users' experiences with information. Some of the big questions I think about: How do humans fundamentally perceive their surroundings? How do they form a unified experience of the world? How can we employ an understanding of human cognition to augment their experiences, and what are the ethics of intervening in human experience? My reading list sheds more light on all of my interests, research or otherwise.
